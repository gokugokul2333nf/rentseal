/**
 * What is being drafted, and the way back to pick something else.
 *
 * The whole catalogue used to be reprinted here, open by default: a customer
 * who had just chosen a warehouse deed from a grid of fifty-five cards arrived
 * at step one and was shown the same fifty-five cards again, above the first
 * question. Choosing twice is not a confirmation, it is a doubt — and it pushed
 * the form itself below the fold.
 *
 * The choice is already made by the time anyone is here, so this states it and
 * offers the catalogue as a link rather than as a list. Going back keeps the
 * draft: the answers are saved against the draft, not against the template, so
 * picking a different document returns to the same parties and address.
