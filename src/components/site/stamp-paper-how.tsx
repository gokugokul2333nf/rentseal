/**
 * How ordering stamp paper works, and why to order it here.
 *
 * The copy is the client's own, with one correction. Their draft said "No
 * branch visits — complete the entire process online", and the process is not
 * entirely online: nothing is charged on the site, the office rings to confirm
 * the order and takes payment on that call. What the customer is actually
 * spared is the queue at the vendor's counter, so that is what it says.
