 * The browser's own scroll-to-fragment and the App Router's scroll handling
 * both fire around hydration, and on a long page the second one wins: a cold
 * load of /#get-started, or "Start my order" clicked from any other route,
 * would start scrolling toward the lead form and get cancelled ~50px in,
 * leaving the visitor at the top of the homepage. Nearer anchors happened to
 * survive it, which is what made it look intermittent.
 *
 * Re-asserting the scroll once the target is actually in the DOM makes every
 * anchor land in the same place, and the retry covers the case where hydration
 * cancels our first attempt too.
