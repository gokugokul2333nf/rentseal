 * A picture of what actually arrives.
 *
 * People were choosing "Any value — e-Stamp" expecting a sheet of paper in an
 * envelope, because in a list of text options an e-Stamp certificate and a
 * ₹100 non-judicial sheet look like the same kind of thing. They are not: one
 * is physical stock a rider carries to your door, the other is a PDF that
 * arrives by email in minutes. So the two are shown differently, and the
 * difference is the point of showing them.
 *
 * The four sheets are the office's own photographs. The e-Stamp has no
 * photograph because there is nothing to photograph — it is a certificate, not
 * stock — so it is drawn, and drawn to look like a document on a screen rather
 * than a sheet in a drawer.
