 * That section carried six named reviews with cities and job titles, none of
 * which were real. Invented social proof is the fastest way for a legal-services
 * business to lose the trust it is trying to buy, and it cannot be corrected
 * later — the names are already published.
 *
 * These are commitments instead: each one is a decision we control, true from
 * the first order, and specific enough to be held to.
