/**
 * Stamp paper catalogue, counter services and delivery model.
 *
 * Tamil Nadu supplies non-judicial stamp paper through licensed vendors and
 * e-Stamp certificates through the authorised channel. We procure both and
 * charge for the errand — the denominations below are the ones ordinary
 * transactions actually call for.
 *
 * Two conventions, both borrowed from certificates.ts and both there for the
 * same reason:
 *
 *   - Physical paper is stocked in ₹100, ₹500, ₹1,000 and ₹5,000 and nothing
 *     else. Listing ₹20, ₹50 or ₹200 as "price on request" was still an offer
 *     to supply them, and the office cannot, so they are gone rather than
 *     unpriced. Duty below ₹100 goes on a ₹100 sheet; anything needing an
 *     exact figure goes on an e-Stamp.
 *   - `price: null` survives for the e-Stamp alone, whose value is whatever
 *     the instrument attracts. It renders "Price on request" rather than a
 *     guess — a made-up figure on a price list is one someone is held to.
 *   - Every price here is the amount payable for the sheet, blank and
 *     unprinted, before delivery. Face value and price are separate fields on
 *     purpose: the difference between them is our procurement charge, and the
 *     UI shows both rather than implying the state charges ₹120 for a ₹100
 *     sheet.
