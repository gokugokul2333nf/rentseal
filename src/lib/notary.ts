/**
 * When notary attestation is compulsory, and when it is a choice.
 *
 * An affidavit is a sworn statement. It is not a contract between two people
 * who can agree what it means — it is a deponent swearing something is true to
 * an officer empowered to administer the oath. Unsworn, it is a signed piece of
 * paper and nothing more: no court, registrar, passport office, bank or college
 * will look at it. So the attestation is not an upsell on an affidavit, it is
 * the thing that makes it an affidavit, and the builder does not offer to leave
 * it out.
 *
 * Everything else — a letting, a lease, a sale, a licence, an indemnity — is
 * valid on execution and, once e-stamped, stands as evidence without a notary.
 * Attestation there buys extra proof of who signed, which is worth having and
 * is worth being asked about rather than charged for silently. Those stay a
 * checkbox.
 */

/**
 * The notary's fee, in rupees.
 *
 * ₹350 buys the signature on the first page together with three green sheets —
 * four sheets in all, which covers most deeds. A document running longer is
 * ₹75 for every sheet past those four, because the notary signs each one.
 *
 * Attestation on plain paper is ₹100 at the counter, but a deed drafted here is
 * executed on stamp paper, so ₹350 is the rate that applies.
