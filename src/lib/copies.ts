/**
 * Extra copies of the finished deed.
 *
 * People ask for these constantly — the landlord wants one, the tenant wants
 * one, the bank wants one, and a college or a consulate wants one it can keep.
 * Until now the office quoted them on the phone, so the figure never appeared
 * in the estimate the customer had already agreed to.
 *
 * Two kinds, priced differently because they cost the office differently:
 *
 *   - A printed copy is a second execution. It goes on its own sheet of stamp
 *     paper, so it carries the stamp charge again, plus ₹10 for every page
 *     printed. Ask for three and you pay for three sheets.
 *   - A soft copy is a scan. There is no sheet, so there is no stamp charge —
 *     only the ₹10 a page for producing it. It is charged once however many
 *     people it is sent to, because a file is not a thing you make twice.
 *
 * On an e-Stamp there is no shelf price for the sheet, so a printed copy is the
 * per-page charge alone. The certificate itself is issued for the exact duty
 * and that is already in the quote.
