/**
 * The drafting spec behind every template LP Stamp Paper offers.
 *
 * The office signed off twenty-four Word templates; this file is those
 * templates, in code. Clauses 1 to 16 are shared and are generated in
 * `clauses.ts` from the builder's answers, so they say "three months' notice"
 * only because somebody chose three. What lives here is the rest: the deed's
 * own title, what the two sides are called, the term the office uses for that
 * instrument, and the specialist clauses that belong to this template and no
 * other — the signboard clause for a shop, the bed-and-room clause for a PG,
 * the standing-crop clause for agricultural land.
 *
 * The clause text is transcribed from the signed-off documents verbatim.
 * Blanks left as ____ are the ones the office fills in by hand at the counter;
 * every one can also be filled in from the builder, because a customer can
 * edit any clause before the deed is sent.
