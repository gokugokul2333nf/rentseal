 * Telegram notifications for the order desk.
 *
 * Mail is the record; this is the nudge. An operator does not sit watching an
 * inbox, but a phone buzzes, and a lead that is answered in ten minutes is
 * worth more than the same lead answered tomorrow.
 *
 * It is also a second copy. When the Google Sheet was removed, mail became the
 * only place a lead landed, which meant SMTP going down took the whole order
 * form with it. A bot that receives the same lead puts that redundancy back,
 * and the two fail for entirely different reasons.
