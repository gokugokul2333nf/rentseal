        Kept deliberately short. This page ran to 26 screens, which is not a
        landing page, it is a brochure — and most of the length was repetition:
        four separate sections all making the "no markup, no office visit" case.

        Moved off: the 25-card template library (now /templates, where it is
        indexable and does not cost every visitor 3,700px of scroll) and the
        old-way comparison table (already on /pricing, and it restated what
        How it works and Commitments already say).

        Also cut: Features. How it works, Features and Commitments were three
        consecutive sections all arguing why to use us. The full thirteen
        features remain on /how-it-works, where the reader has asked for them.
