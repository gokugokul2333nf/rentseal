      "Where attestation is included or added, the signatures on your agreement are attested by an independent notary public appointed under the Notaries Act, 1952. The notary is solely responsible for that act. Attestation confirms who signed; it is not a legal opinion on the contents.",

An electronic signature so affixed has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature under Section 3A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, read with the Second Schedule to that Act.",
